# Logistic Regression with Python

In this project, I implemented **Logistic Regression** for solving a **classification problem** using Python.  
The project focuses on **data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation**, and applying logistic regression to **real-world data** using **Scikit-Learn**.

## **Objectives**

After completing this project, I was able to:

- Understand the concept of **Logistic Regression** and its applications in classification problems.
- Preprocess raw data for model training and testing.
- Implement **Logistic Regression** using **Scikit-Learn**.
- Evaluate model performance using different metrics.
- Work with real-world datasets to build predictive models.

## **Project Overview**

**Logistic Regression** is one of the most popular supervised machine learning algorithms used for **binary and multi-class classification**.  
In this project, I explored its implementation step by step, including:

### **Key Steps**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Training**: Using **LogisticRegression** from **Scikit-Learn**.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting parameters to improve accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measuring performance using metrics like:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - ROC Curve & AUC Score
